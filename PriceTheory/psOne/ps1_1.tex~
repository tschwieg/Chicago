Consider a world where there are three important factors, consumers,
landowners and firms.

\section{Consumers}

Consumers value their leisure time as well as their consumption of the
single good produced in this world: $Y$. For a given time period, they
must choose their labor/leisure trade-off as well as the region in
which they are inhabiting. Assume that they can freely travel between
regions. Since the consumers value only the good and their leisure, we
may model their utility function as: $U( Y, Le)$.

Assume that there are many consumers in each region, such that they
are price-takers in the labor market. Then they receive wages $w_i$
for working in each region $i$. The consumer's problem in this world
is then:
\begin{align*}
  \max_{Y,L,Le,i} &U( Y, Le )\\
  \text{s.t} Y &\leq w_i L\\
  L + Le &= 1\\
  i &\in \{ 1, 2, ..., K\}
\end{align*}

If we believe that utility is increasing in $Y$ and $Le$, then these
constraints can be simplified as all money will be spent on good $Y$
and leisure is completely determined by labor time.

\begin{align*}
  \max_{L,i} &U( w_i L, Le)\\
  \text{s.t} L &\in [0,1]\\
  i &\in \{ 1, 2, ..., K\}
\end{align*}

Immediately we can notice that the only part of this decision where the
region chosen by the consumer is relevant is in his wage. His leisure
and purchasing power of $Y$ are unaffected by where he lives, except
indirectly through the wage. This implies that the consumer will first
select the region with the highest wage, and then choose his leisure
time based on that wage.

This implies that the only equilibrium that can be supported is the
equilibrium where all the regions have the same wage paid. If there
was some region with a higher wage, then no consumer would want to
live anywhere else, and firms in that specific region could lower
their wage and make strictly more profit.

The consumer's problem has simplified to this:
\begin{align*}
  \max_L & U( w L, 1 - L)\\
  \text{s.t.} L &\in [0,1]
\end{align*}


\section{Firms}

Suppose there are many firms in each region of the
economy all of which using the same production function, and producing
output. Suppose that there exists a capital market exogenous to this
model, and an accompanying rental rate of capital, $r$. Since there
are many small firms without market power, they must be price takers
in the market, and suppose that capital is homogeneous so that the
market is competitive.

From the discussion on the consumer, it is known that every firm will
have to offer the same wage to each worker regardless of region that
the firm is located in.

The firms face a production function of
\begin{equation*}
  Y = F( T, K, L)
\end{equation*}
Where $T = Q_iX$, is the ``efficiency units'' of the land, $K$ is the
capital employed, and $L$ is the amount of labor employed.
This function exhibits constant returns to scale.

The firm faces the optimization question of:
\begin{equation*}
  \max_{T,K,L} \Pi = F( T, K, L ) - tT - wL - rK
\end{equation*}
Consider the cost function of this firm:
\begin{align*}
  C(y,t,w,r) = &\min_{T,K,L} tT + wL + rK\\
  &\text{s.t.} F(T,K,L) = y
\end{align*}

This is equivalent to the Hicksian system for a utility function of
$F(T,K,L)$. So the cost function is concave. We also know that the
solution is characterized by a tangency of the expenditure with the
isoquant. Since the production function exhibits CRS, its level curves
all have the same slope following a ray out of the origin. So if we
can find one tangency for a given output $y$, then the optimal
inputs for any other output must lie along the ray. (This is assuming
some stuff about isoquants)

This tells us that the expansion path, or the choice of inputs to meet
larger and larger outputs follows along a line. This means that as you
scale y, each of the inputs scales by the same amount, increasing the
cost by that amount as well. As the firm is a price taker in output as
well as input, it must earn zero profit.

Following these assumptions are the standard competitive assumptions
\begin{align*}
  F_L(T,K,L) = w\\
  F_K(T,K,L) = r\\
  F_T(T,K,L) = t
\end{align*}

That is, that the price of each factor input equals the benefit of
each factor input.

\section{Land Owners}

Each land owner has $X$ quantity of land where the quality of each
piece of land is given by $Q_i$. This can be thought of us each firm
having a different quantity of homogeneous land. Since there is
nothing else that the land-owners can do with their land, they face no
opportunity cost of renting the land to the firms. They are willing to
accept any price for their land.

This leads to a perfectly inelastic supply at the maximum amount of
land supplied. The Land-Owner has no monopoly power over the land
since there are many, and has no ability to restrict his output to
maximize his revenue, he simply faces a price and tries to sell as
much of his land as possible. As a result supply is fixed at the
amount of land in the region, and is perfectly inelastic. 


\section{Equilibrium}

In Equilibrium, there will be no excess demand or supply in terms of
labor, capital, land or the good $Y$. This gives us several conditions
that must hold:

The first condition is that the wages must be equal across the
different regions. The rental rate is equal between the different
regions as well.

The rental rate of capital is completely exogenous within this model,
so it fixes the marginal productivity of capital for all firms to be
constant. Although the wage rate is determined endogenously, it is
fixed constant between all regions as well.

Since the quantity of land is fixed per region, the effective quantity
of land is fixed per region. Equilibrium in the land market will occur
where $MPT$ intersects this perfectly inelastic supply. As a result
the price per effective unit of land will be constant.

One important thing to note is that all of these calculations have
been in terms of the effective output of the land. This must scale
directly with the quality of the land by the given equation: $R(Q,X) =
tQX$. That is, land prices are a linear function of land quality. All
other factor prices remain constant between the different
regions. As the quality of land is driven upwards, more land is used,
as supply is perfectly elastic.

As more effective land is used, it must be the case that the firm is
producing more output. This can be seen by considering the conditional
factor demand equations. The factor demand for land at a given level
of output for the first quantity of effective land is optimal, so the
only way that the high quantity is optimal is if more output is
produced. If output increases, we have shown that the optimal path is
linear. This tells us that factor quantities vary exactly with the
quality of the land as well. That is: $Q_2L_1 = Q_1L_2$.

\section{Part B}

Now consumers must consume a fixed amount of land when they work in a
region. Assume that per region there is a cost of renting given by
$R_i$. To work in a particular region, consumers now have income: $w_i
L - R_i$.

The land-owners no longer have a perfectly inelastic supply curve
either. They face a second option of renting out their land to
consumers who wish to work in the area. For an equilibrium to occur,
the land-owner should be indifferent between renting out his land and
selling it to a consumer. However this depends on the quantity land,
which is separate from the effective quantity.

Indifference implies that $R_i = t = MPT$. Since each consumer costs a
fixed amount of land, it is equivalent to consumers costing more
effective land in more effective regions. As $Q$ increases, each
consumer costs more ``effective land'' and thus raises $MPT = R_i$

Consumers must also be indifferent between this change. Their new
budget line, adjusted by the rent cost must lie tangent to the same
indifference curve as the budget line of all other regions. This
determines the wage increase that must exist to compensate for the
rental cost.

Since there is less land available, $MPT$ has increased,
and higher wages mean that $MPL$ has increased, but $MPK$ remains
constant. The decreased quantity of land should reduce the
productivity of workers, so for their to be an increase in the
productivity, there must be a decrease in the labor demanded.
