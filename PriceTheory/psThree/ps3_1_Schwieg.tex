\section{Setup}

The Owner elects to choose between two types of managers: the more
skillful manager and the less skillful relative. Both types of
managers have the ability to ``steal'' profit away from the owner at
the cost of some level of effort. We shall refer to the more skillful
and unrelated manager as the contractor, and the other as the
relative. The contractor has a higher talent $T_c > T_r$. Either
manager faces the same cost in terms of effort for stealing the profit
away.
