Suppose that both private and public universities have the same share
in the basket that is used to determine inflation. Therefore
proportional increases in the tuition of both types of universities
will have the same effect on the average


\section{How would a proportional increase in the tuition of both
  types of schools affect the market share of public schools?}

First note that an increase in the tuition of both types of schools
will increase the average price level at a macro level. There is
substantial spending on education and this will be reflected as
including education spending in the basket of goods examined.

For a proportional increase in the tuition of $\alpha$, the average price
level will increase by $\beta < \alpha$ as education spending is a small
portion of the overall budget.
