\begin{document}

The owner in this model faces a decision on hiring between two
different managers. One is a family member, which will be referred to
as the related manager. The other is a more skilled manager whom is
not related to the owner. This worker will be referred to as the
foreigner.

Consider a world where the owner faces profits of $\Pi_i, i \in \{0,1\}$
which is the profit that the owner earns under each particular
manager.

\begin{equation*}
  \Pi_i = \beta_i ( T_i + u - e_i )
\end{equation*}
Where $T_i$ is the talent of manager $i$, $\beta_i$ is share of profit the
owner keeps under manager $i$.  $i$, and $e_i$ is the amount stolen by
manager $i$.

If the owner elects to hire a family manager he faces the problem of:
\begin{align*}
  U_0 = \alpha U( \beta_0 ( T_0 + u - e_0 ) ) + (1-\alpha) U( (1-\beta)(T_0 + u - e_0) +
  e_0) \quad \alpha \in (.5,1)\\
  U_0 = \alpha U( \beta_0 ( T_0 + u - e_0 ) ) + (1-\alpha)  U( (1-\beta)(T_0 + u) + \beta e_0 )\quad \alpha \in (.5,1)\\
  U_1 = U( \beta ( T_1 + u - e_1 ) )
\end{align*}

Manager $i$ obtains Utility governed by:

\begin{align*}
  U( (1-\beta) ( T_i + u - e_i) + e_i - \gamma e_i )
          &= U( (1-\beta) ( T_i + u ) - (1-\beta) e_i + e_i - \gamma e_i )\\
          &= U( (1-\beta)( T_i + u) + \beta e_i- \gamma e_i )\\
          &= U( (1-\beta)(T_i + u) + (\beta-\gamma)e_i )
\end{align*}

From this, we can see that the benefit to the manager of stealing is
$\beta$, the portion of the profit that would be given to the owner. The
cost is $\gamma$ which is the effort that must be expended to obtain one
dollar. Thus for there to be no theft, we must find that $\gamma > \beta$.
