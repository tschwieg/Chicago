\section*{What can you say about the relationship between prevalence
  and new infections? Separate your answer into a mechanical
  component, related to random pairings of partners and a behavioral
  component.}

Let us believe in a world in which there are three types of
actors. Actors who do not have syphilis, actors who have contracted
syphilis but are not yet contagious, and actors who have syphilis and
are still contagious.

Any individual actor knows which state he is in, but not the state of
whom'stever he is paired with. All individuals are aware of the amount
of contagious individuals, summarized by the probability of obtaining
syphilis from a random encounter $p$.

A healthy individual who does not have syphilis scores some benefit
$\alpha$ from a sexual encounter, and faces cost $\beta$ if he contracts
syphilis. 

An individual chooses his amount of sexual encounters $\alpha$, after $\alpha$
encounters, his probability of contracting the disease is given by $P
= 1 - (1-p)^{\alpha}$. This is increasing in the number of encounters, though
it is concave. Let us believe that there is a monetary component to
these encounters, either in time spent in seduction, or in actual
costs spent on dates. These two factors can be combined into a cost
function $c(\alpha,p)$. 

This cost function is state dependent, as individuals that have
syphilis cannot obtain the disease a second time. These individuals
face a cost of $c(\alpha,0)$. Let us believe that there is some guilt
factor associated with giving syphilis to another person. Call this
level $\beta$. This guilt is only felt if syphilis is translated to
another person. In expectation, this is $\alpha ( 1 - p)\beta$.

The benefit of $\alpha$ sexual encounters is given by $u(\alpha)$ which is an
increasing and concave function. Individuals in equilibrium will
copulate to the point where $u(\alpha) = c(\alpha,p)$

\section*{b}

For there to be a steady state, we would need $y_{t+1} = y_t$. Note
that $NewInfections_{t-x} = P$

If a copulation occurs between two clean individuals, then there is no
added infection, as is the case if the copulation occurs between two
diseased individuals.

The only case when a new infection is created is when an infected
person does the dirty with a clean individual. Immediately this
suggests that no infected individuals is a steady state.

Any other steady state requires that $r y_t = NewInfections_{t-x}$.
