\section{Rust (1987) Bus engine replacement problem}

\subsection{1}

Since the data in the .csv file gives us the end of period mileage, we
must find that it increases unless there is an engine replacement at
the start of that time period. In this case, the mileage would have
decreased.

It is possible that we could miss a case where the engine is replaced,
and then there is more mileage used in that single time period than
wear that it had previously. We will abstract from this case and
continue as if this never occurs.

\subsection{2}

What is Rust (1987)'s condition independence assumption which we will
maintain for the rest of the problem? Discuss briefly.

The conditional independence assumption is that $x_{t+1}$ is independent
of both $(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t+1})$
\begin{align*}
  \Pr( x_{t+1},\epsilon_{t+1} \vert x_t, \epsilon_t, a_t, \phi ) &= \Pr( \epsilon_{t+1} \vert
                                              x_{t+1},x_t, \epsilon_t, \alpha_t,
                                              \phi) \Pr( x_{t+1} \vert x_t,
                                              \epsilon_t, a_t, \phi)\\
  &= \Pr( \epsilon_{t+1}) \Pr( x_{t+1} \vert x_t a_t \phi)
\end{align*}

This means that the different draws of $\epsilon$ can only affect $x_t$
through $a_t$, and ensures that we will be able to obtain closed form
likelihood functions for $\Pr( a_t = j \vert x_t, \theta, \phi)$.

\subsection{3}

Discretize $x_t$ and estimate the Markov transition probability
$p(x_{t+1} \vert x_t, t_t, \theta_3)$ using the hint that it is an upper
triangular stochastic matrix.
