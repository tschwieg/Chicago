Quantifying Social Influence in an Online Cultural Market
Coco Krumme, Manuel Cebrian, Galen Pickard, Sandy Pentland
May 9, 2012

We revisit experimental data from an online cultural market in which 14,000 users interact to download songs,
and develop a simple model that can explain seemingly complex outcomes. Our results suggest that individual 
behavior is characterized by a two-step process–the decision to sample and the decision to download a song.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, social influence is material to the first step only. The model also identifies
the role of placement in mediating social signals, and suggests that in this market with anonymous feedback cues,
social influence serves an informational rather than normative role.

This paper somewhat creates a stuctural model, creating this two-stage discrete choice situation, and focusing on
 conditional probabilities between the two stages to predict if a consumer will listen. It still relies on simulation,
 and has no endogenized notions of inequality or unpredictability. The structure only serves to create a predictive
model for whether someone will listen rather than a casual one.

Of songs and men: a model for multiple choice with herding
Christian Borghesi Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
03 March 2007

We propose a generic model for multiple choice situations in the presence of herding and compare it with recent empirical
results from a Web-based music market experiment. The model predicts a phase transition between a weak imitation phase and
a strong imitation, ‘fashion’ phase, where choices are driven by peer pressure and the ranking of individual preferences is
strongly distorted at the aggregate level. The model can be calibrated to reproduce the main experimental results of Salganik
et al. (Science, 311, 854–856 (2006)); we show in particular that the value of the social influence parameter can be estimated
from the data. In one of the experimental situation, this value is found to be close to the critical value of the model.

This paper proposes a model for multiple choice, and then simulates the model with some estimated values used in the paper,
and shows that these simulated results are consistent with the results noted in the experiment. It is not fitting a model
structurally, but does have quite a bit of structure for their model.

An empirical study of observational learning
Peter W. Newberry

This article provides an empirical examination of observational learning. Using data from an online market for music,
 I ?nd that observational learning bene?ts consumers, producers of high quality music, and the online platform.
 I also study the role of pricing as a friction to the learning process by comparing outcomes under demand-based pricing
 to counterfactual pricing schemes. I ?nd that employing a ?xed price (the industry standard) can hamper learning by
 reducing the incentive to experiment, resulting in less consumer surplus, but more expected revenue for the platform.

This paper Structurally estimates the online market for music, but uses a seperate data set rather than the one used by Salganik.
 While he references Salganik's paper he states that their results show the long-run effect of what his paper is describing.
'In a project closely related to the current study, Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006) show descriptive evidence of the long-run
 effect of social learning in an experimental music market. I quantify these effects by estimating a structural model.'

PARAMETER EVALUATION OF A SIMPLE MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SOCIAL INTERACTION

IGNACIO GALLO, ADRIANO BARRA and PIERLUIGI CONTUCCI

The aim of this work is to implement a statistical mechanics theory of social interaction, generalizing econometric discrete 
choice models. A class of simple mean-field discrete models is introduced and discussed both from the theoretical and phenomenological
point of view. We propose a parameter evaluation procedure and test it by fitting the model against three families of data coming from
different cases: the estimated interaction parameters are found to have similar positive values, giving a quantitative confirmation
of the peer imitation behavior found in social psychology. Furthermore, all the values of the interaction parameters belong to the
phase transition regime suggesting its possible role in the study of social systems.

This is an attempt to generalize thediscrete choice model further with interaction parameters, but not really relatecd to 'learning'
about the enviorment, just enjoying what they believe others to enjoy. This data is then used in census data on several
social matters in Italy.

Aligning Popularity and Quality in Online Cultural Markets
Pascal Van Hentenryck, Andres Abeliuk, Franco Berbeglia, Felipe Maldonado, Gerardo Berbeglia

Social influence is ubiquitous in cultural markets and plays
an important role in recommendations for books, songs, and
news articles to name only a few. Yet social influence is often
presented in a bad light, often because it supposedly increases
market unpredictability. Here we study a model of trial-offer
markets, in which participants try products and later decide
whether to purchase. We consider a simple policy which recovers
product quality and ranks the products by quality when
presenting them to market participants. We show that, in this
setting, market efficiency always benefits from social influence.
Moreover, we prove that the market converges almost
surely to a monopoly for the product of highest quality, making
the market both predictable and asymptotically optimal.
Computational experiments confirm that the quality ranking
policy quickly identifies “blockbusters”, outperforms other
policies, and is highly predictable.

This paper finds results opposite to Salganik's paper, directly contrasting the results from his experimental approach. He uses 
simulations to try to model the music lab experiments. His estimate of quality is derived from the data used in the Music Lab even 
if there is not a structural estimation from the data set. This paper finds instead that markets are still efficient, and converges 
to a monopoly.
